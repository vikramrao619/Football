      "This is the first of two IPython notebooks that are part of an ongoing examination of historical NFL data. In this notebook, I process data obtained in raw form from www.profootballreference.com. Each team's data comes from the site's \"Team Encyclopedia\" pages (for example, the San Diego Chargers data is from here - http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sdg/). I exported all 32 of these files as .csv files and saved them locally, then processed them in Python. To start, I process each team's .csv individually. First, I clean each file (mostly renaming variables and eliminating an extra row at the top). I then calculate a few statistics team-specific statistics such as cumulative win-loss statistics and a new variable representing progress in the playoffs. After merging each team file together, I calculate a few novel statistics that I will later use to study how parity has changed over time. I output two files: one containing all the data and one containining only the parity variables for use in R. "

     "source": [
      "Consider the current NFL schedule structure, which has 32 teams and a 16 game schedule. The outcome of a regular season can be written down formally as a list of each team's win percentage: $\\{winpct_{Atlanta}, winpct_{Buffalo}, winpct_{Carolina}, ...\\}$. We can think of this set as a point in $\\mathbb{R^{32}}$, in which each dimension corresponds to a team and each coordinate of the point represents a team's win percentage. The point takes on a restricted set of values with $\\mathbb{R^{32}}$. For starters, win percentages lie between 0 and 1. Thus, all valid sets of win percentages $x$ will satisfy $\\ x \\in [0, 1]^{32}$. Furthermore, the league average win percentage must always equal .500, as every game has a winner and a loser (and ties are counted as half a win for both teams). Thus, we are actually restricted to $ SeasonOutcomePlane = \\{ x \\in [0, 1]^{32} \\space \\colon \\space \\sum_{i = 1}^{32}x_i = 16 \\}$, where the indices $i$ refer to each of the 32 teams. \n",
      "\n",
      "For year $y$, define $SeasonOutcome_{y} = \\{x \\in SeasonOutcomePlane_{y}: x_{i} = winpercentage_{y, i}\\}$. The introduction of indexing by $y$ simply specifies the year of each statistic in question.  \n",
      "\n",
      "A natural way to measure parity in a given year is to calculate the \"distance between seasons\", or the Cartesian distance from $SeasonOutcome$ between the current season and the last season. For year $y$, define $WinPctParity$ as follows: \n",
      "\n",
      "$\\Large WinPctParity_{y} = (\\sum_{i = 1}^{32}(SeasonOutcome_{y, i} - SeasonOutcome_{y-1, i})^{2})^{\\frac{1}{2}}$\n",
      "\n",
      "This number represents how \"distant\" the current season was from the last season by win percentage. The number will be relatively large if a few teams that were very good in the prior season become very bad in the current season (or vice versa). Likewise, if most of the good teams remain good and most of the bad teams remain bad, the distance between seasons will be relatively small. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the distances between seasons require normalization. This is because the number of teams in the league has grown over time, thus increasing the dimension of $SeasonOutcomePlane$. This means that comparisons of distance over time are not apples to apples comparisons. I deal with this issue by dividing the distance in a given year by the square root of the number of teams in the league. The square root of the number of teams in the league represents the maximal possible distance between two seasons. Suppose that in year 1, half the league goes 0-16 and the other half goes 16-0. Then in year 2, the teams that had gone 0-16 finish 16-0 and the teams that had gone 16-0 finish 0-16. The distance between these two points in $SeasonOutcomePlane$ is $\\sqrt{32}$, or the square root of the number of teams in the league. In the few seasons during which the league had an odd number of teams, I subtract one from the number of teams in the league (the story being that one of the teams wins half its games in both seasons while the others follow the flip-flop scenario described previously). Thus, the final number calculated is:\n",
      "\n",
      "$\\Large NormedWinPctParity_{y} = \\dfrac{WinPctParity_{y}}{NumberOfTeamsInLeague_{i}^{1/2}}$\n",
      "\n",
      "I have glossed over a few technical details here that I plan to revisit in due time. The $SeasonOutcomePlane$ hyperplane is actually a much more geometrically complex shape prescribed by the exact structure of the NFL schedule in a given year (for example, two teams that play each other can't both go 16-0 or 0-16). The dataset I've used does not contain the requisite information to specify this shape. My normalization figures are therefore imperfect, but they provide an adequate starting point. In addition, the $SeasonOutcomePlane$ is actually a dense but finite grid of points because every game results in a win, loss, or tie. Thus, a single team's record in a 16 game season is one of 49 values (17 possible records ranging from 0-16 to 16-0 without any ties and 16 additional possibilities accounting for ties). This leads to a discussion of whether the $L_{2}$ norm is appropriate but we will not worry about this issue for the time being. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, I've chosen to only define this variable for the Super Bowl Era (which begins in 1966, so parity is defined from 1967 onwards) because this was the point after which every NFL and AFL team had the same goal each season. "

      "While changes in win percentages represent an obvious way to define parity, they completely ignore playoff sucess. In light of this, I created a second parity variable focused exclusively on playoff success. The methodology is similar to before, with a few twists. To begin, I assign six possible outcomes to a team's season: missing the playoffs, losing a wild card game, losing a divisional round playoff game, losing a conference championship game, losing the Super Bowl, or winning the Super Bowl. These outcomes are assigned a \"playoff rating\": numerical values 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 respectively. I then calculate distance from season to season in the same manner as before, but this time I use Manhattan or $L_{1}$ norm: $\\lVert \\mathbf{x} \\rVert_1 = \\sum_{i = 1}^{32}\\lvert x_i \\rvert $. Manhattan norm is preferable to Cartesian distance in this situation because teams are restricted a relatively sparse grid. Thinking about diagonal distances through this grid is suspicious. Talking about paths that traverse diagonals is somewhat meaningless. Thus, playoff rating is defined as follows:\n",

      "$\\Large PlayoffRatingParity_{y} = \\sum_{i = 1}^{32}\\lvert SeasonOutcome_{y, i} - SeasonOutcome_{y-1, i} \\rvert$\n",

      "The normalization factor for playoff rating is based on a detailed analysis of the NFL playoff structure. Without going into full details, the playoff structure has changed quite a bit over the years and with greater frequency than the number of teams. As with win percentage, the normalization factor represents the maximal possible year of year change in the total playoff rating. After normalization, we have: \n",
